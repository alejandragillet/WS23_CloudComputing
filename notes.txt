Build the new image and spin up the two containers:
$ docker-compose up -d --build

Create the table:
$ docker-compose exec flask python manage.py create_db

Seed the table:
$ docker-compose exec flask python manage.py seed_db
Get the following error?
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError)
FATAL:  database "hello_flask_dev" does not exist

Run docker-compose down -v to remove the volumes along with the containers. Then, re-build the images, run the containers, and apply the migrations.

Ensure the users table was created:
$ docker-compose exec db psql --username=postgres --dbname=postgres

\c hello_flask_dev
\dt


# REMEMBER

to delete docker image! not enough with docker-compose down
make sure postgres is on before flask! Sometimes depends_on command on compose does not seem to work
the app needs to have all for working! data in users, decks and results
the app needs the app.app_context() when interacting with db
was psycopg2 in docker-compose the one that did the trick??
